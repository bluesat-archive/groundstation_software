
=== WINDOWS ===

1. Download these:
- zadig (sdr driver installer) http://zadig.akeo.ie/
- sdr# (sdr visualisation + audio software) http://sdrsharp.com/#download
- virtual cable (pipes audio out into audio in) http://vb-audio.pagesperso-orange.fr/Cable/index.htm
- Qtmm AFSK1200 Decoder (extracts APRS packets from audio) http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtmm/
- cmder w/ gcc (unix terminal for windows) http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~daniels/portable_tools/
- aprsTranslator.c (translates APRS packet into humanspeak) bluesat github


2. Test SDR:
- Plug NooElec+Antenna into laptop
- Open up SDRSharp.exe
- Source -> 'RTL-SDR / USB' (if "1 compatible devices have been found but are all busy", reinstall drivers (step 2a))
- Radio -> select 'NFM' (narrow FM)
- Radio -> uncheck 'Snap to grid'
- Numbers up the top -> type in frequency of handheld radio (units in Hz)
- Press play button
- On top graph, reposition (click) the red line to where the spike appears (signal appears on waterfall (bottom graph) as well)
- Check w/ earphones to see if signal is audible (volume is at the top of window)

2a. Reinstall SDR drivers:
- Open zadig
- Options -> List All Devices
- Drop-down menu -> RTL2838UHIDIR
- Up/down arrows -> libusbK (if device is still busy, try the others)
- Install drivers

3. Pipe audio to AFSK Decoder
- Install virtual cable
- Windows control panel->Sound
- Playback tab -> CABLE Input -> Set Default
- Open AFSK Decoder
- Input -> CABLE Output
- Press play button

4. Receive APRS Packets
- In SDR#
- Radio -> select 'WFM' (wide FM)
- Frequency: 145.175.000Hz (APRS freq)
- Press play button
- Check on AFSK window that audio is being received (green bar should be moving)
- Power on MT-AIO (ensure antenna is plugged in first)
- Place MT-AIO in an area with suitable reception (i.e. outside) - blinking green LED == no reception
- Every 30s a signal should appear in SDR# - position the red line at the centre of the peak
- Text should appear in the AFSK window - this is the APRS packet
e.g.
17:58:42$ fm VK2MRW-0 to S3U5P8-0 via WIDE2-1 UI  PID=F0
          `O)vl .O/'"4@}|!$%A'l|!wwd!|3


5. Compile & Run APRS Translator
- Open cmder
- Navigate to directory containing aprsTranslator.c
- $ gcc -Werror -Wall -O -o aprsTranslator aprsTranslator.c
- $ mv aprsTranslator aprsTranslator.exe
- $ aprsTranslator.exe
- Copy in APRS packet 1 line at a time (windows only accepts 1 line at a time for some reason; when copying 2nd line, include the spaces at the beginning)
- Information will be printed to screen (in windows, degrees symbol messes up (° turns into ┬░))
e.g.
================================
Enter APRS String:
17:59:12$ fm VK2MRW-0 to S3U5P8-0 via WIDE2-1 UI  PID=F0
          `O)vl .O/'"4@}|!%%@'m|!wwd!|3
--------------------------------

=== OSX ===

1. Download these:
- gqrx (SDR visualisation + audio software) http://eliasoenal.com/2012/09/30/osx-port-of-the-awesome-gqrx-sdr-software/
- aprsTranslator.c (translates APRS packet into humanspeak) bluesat github

2. Receive APRS Packets
- Plug in NooElec+Antenna into laptop
- Open up gqrx, use recommended settings if dialog box comes up
- Set frequency at 145.175MHz, press the 'on' button (top left)
- Power on MT-AIO (ensure antenna is plugged in first)
- Place MT-AIO in an area with suitable reception (i.e. outside) - blinking green LED == no reception
- Every 30s a signal should appear in gqrx - position the red line at the centre of the peak (scroll to zoom)
- Data -> AFSK 1200 Decoder - APRS packets should appear in this window

3. Translate APRS Packets
- In Terminal, navigate to directory containing aprsTranslator.c
- $ gcc -Werror -Wall -O -o aprsTranslator aprsTranslator.c
- $ ./aprsTranslator
- Copy in APRS packet - information will be printed to screen
- Coordinates can be copied into Google Maps
